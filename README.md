# garmin_scripts
Collection of AppleScripts to automatically back up activities, move route files onto the device, or update a map from Wandrer.com

This is a set of scripts I've developed over time to make it easy to do the routine tasks that I used to manually do dragging and dropping files.
When I plug in my device, it automatically moves any activity files into the folder that I use for that purpose on Dropbox, and if it finds a map that I've donwloaded from Wandrer.com it puts that on my Garmin device, replacing any that is there.
Likewise if the device is already mounted if I download any courses as fit files (e.g. from RideWithGps.com or from Strava) they will be moved into the New Files folder on my Garmin.
